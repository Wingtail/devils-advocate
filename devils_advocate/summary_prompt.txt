This is the moderator speaking. You both have reached a consensus. Summarize the discussion, highlighting key points and the consensus reached. This serves as your memory. The entire conversation that you made with the questioner will be forgotten. To ensure you can resume the discussion with only your memory, summarize the entire conversation so that it includes all of the most important details and concepts you think you need. Be as elaborate as possible.

This is a dry run of the current version of devil's advocate. 

Note that the devil's advocate prompt encourages the LLM to design a prompt that instructs an LLM model to solve the task. Therefore, it does not actually perform the task itself. 

This is a direct compare and contrast with a regular GPT4 run. To provide a direct contrast, I modified the task specification so that it instructs GPT4 to design a detailed instruction prompt in solving this task rather than directly solving it. I attached this prompt before the **Task Specification** prompt:

Designing a Doom-themed video game using the C language involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide on how to go about it:

**1. Game Concept and Design:**
First, you need to conceptualize the game. This includes the game's storyline, characters, and environment. Since it's a Doom-themed game, it should be a first-person shooter game with a horror and science fiction theme. The main character should be a space marine who fights against hordes of demons from Hell. The game environment should be a series of maze-like levels, each more challenging than the last.

**2. Game Engine:**
Next, you need to choose a game engine. Since we're using C language, a suitable game engine would be Raylib. Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming. It's written in pure C and is highly portable.

**3. Game Programming:**
Now, it's time to start programming the game. Here are the main components you need to program:

- **Game Loop:** This is the heart of the game. It's a loop that keeps running as long as the game is active. It handles user inputs, updates the game state, and renders the game to the screen.

- **Player Character:** You need to program the player character. This includes the character's movement, shooting, and health.

- **Enemies:** You need to program the enemies. This includes their movement, attacks, and health.

- **Levels:** You need to program the game levels. This includes the layout of each level, the placement of enemies, and the level progression.

- **Collision Detection:** You need to program the collision detection. This is how the game knows when the player character or enemies have hit something.

- **Graphics and Sound:** You need to program the graphics and sound. This includes the game's visual elements and sound effects.

**4. Game Testing:**
Once you've programmed the game, you need to test it. This involves playing the game and looking for any bugs or issues that need to be fixed.

**5. Game Release:**
Finally, once you're happy with the game, you can release it. This involves packaging the game into a format that can be easily downloaded and played.

Remember, designing a video game is a complex task that requires a lot of time and effort. But with patience and dedication, you can create a Doom-themed video game that players will enjoy.
